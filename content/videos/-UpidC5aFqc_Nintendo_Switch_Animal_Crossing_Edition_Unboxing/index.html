  I am considering starting a new island with my extra copy of the game.


  I am so excited to finally have the Animal Crossing Edition of Nintendo Switch.
  I really want to stream playing games with friends. The design of the Switch is
  so adorable. Want to follow my coding stream (mainly in Python) and potential gaming
  stream? Follow me on Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho).
