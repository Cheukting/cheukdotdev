description: 'Moving from iterators late week, we have introduced generators (or generator
  functions). Which lets you create iterators just like writing a function, with yield.
  It also got a "send" method which lets you pass information from one iterator to
  another, setting the stage for async in Python. If you have any questions or any
  suggestions about which Python topics to cover, please leave your comment at my
  Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho)


  You can get the slide deck here (https://slides.com/cheukting_ho) and the example
  code and homework form GitHub here (https://github.com/Cheukting/python02hero).
