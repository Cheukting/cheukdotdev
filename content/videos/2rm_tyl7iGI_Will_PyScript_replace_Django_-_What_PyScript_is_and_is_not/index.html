description: 'In this talk, through some examples and demos of PyScript, we will see
  how to use it - just include the CDN URL, understand that it is a frontend-only
  Python that runs on the browser and learn the fact that it can work with javascript
  in conjunction.


  After that, we will look at what is under the hood - Pyodide - which is a Python
  distribution for the browser. It is what is essential to power PyScript. We will
  discover what is the difference between using PyScript and Pyodide.


  Finally, we will conclude what is already available in PyScirpt like which library
  you can run on PyScript and which ones are still yet to come. In the end, we will
  answer the question - Will PyScript replace Django?


  This talk is for those who are curious about PyScript and the idea of running Python
  in the browser in general. We will assume no piror knowledge about it.
