description: 'Decision tree-based algorithms are a family of common algorithms to
  be used in many machine learning applications. By drawing conclusions based on the
  labelled data provided, it can build a decision path to give a prediction based
  on the different values of different features given.


  If you have any questions or any suggestions about which Python or Data Science
  topics to cover, please leave your comment at my Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho)


  You can get the slide deck here (https://slides.com/cheukting_ho/legend-data-pandas1/).
  The notebook that I used can be found here (https://github.com/Cheukting/legend_data).
