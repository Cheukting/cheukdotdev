description: 'In recent years, Rust has been getting more and more popular over other
  similar programming languages like C and C++ due to its robust compiler checking
  and ownership rules to make sure memory is safe. Hence there are more and more Python
  libraries that have been written in Rust natively with a Python API interface. One
  of the tools that have been driving this movement is PyO3, a toolset that proves
  Rust bindings for Python and tools for creating native Python extension modules.


  In this interactive workshop, we will cover the very basics of using PyO3. There
  will be hands-on exercises to go from how to set up the project environment to writing
  a "toy" Python library written in Rust using PyO3. We will cover a lot of expectations
  of the API provided by PyO3 to create Python functions, modules, handling errors
  and converting types.


  Goal


  To give developers who are not familiar with PyO3 an introduction to PyO3 so they
  can consider building their Python libraries with Rust to make use of Rust''s memory-safe
  property and parallelism ability.


  Target audiences


  Any developers who are interested in developing Python libraries using Rust. It
  will be an advantage if the attendees are comfortable writing in Rust. However,
  attendees are not required to be familiar with Rust as all the Rust codes will be
  provided. Basic knowledge of Python will be assumed from the attendees.
