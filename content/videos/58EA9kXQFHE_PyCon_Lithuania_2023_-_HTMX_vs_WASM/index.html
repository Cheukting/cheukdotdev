  rise of Pyodide and PyScript alongside the HTMX library, demonstrating their usage.
  It invites you to reconsider their application-building approaches and questions
  the need for JavaScript in web development. You will explore several popular tools
  in recent years, making them rethink their approach to building their applications.
