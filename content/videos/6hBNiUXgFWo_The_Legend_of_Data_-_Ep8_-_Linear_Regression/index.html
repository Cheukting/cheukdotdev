  Starting from this week we will be doing machine learning. Linear regression is
  considered to be machine learning 101, and from seeing how linear regression works
  we will have a basic idea of how we can draw conclusions and make predictions with
  data.


  If you have any questions or any suggestions about which Python or Data Science
  topics to cover, please leave your comment at my Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho)


  You can get the slide deck here (https://slides.com/cheukting_ho/legend-data-pandas1/).
  The notebook that I used can be found here (https://github.com/Cheukting/legend_data).
