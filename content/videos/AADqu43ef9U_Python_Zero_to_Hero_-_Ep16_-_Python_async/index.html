  Today we continue our story from generators to async. Introducing both the coroutine
  in asyncio (introduced in Python 3.4) and awaitable async function (introduced in
  Python 3.5). If you have any questions or any suggestions about which Python topics
  to cover, please leave your comment at my Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho)


  You can get the slide deck here (https://slides.com/cheukting_ho) and the example
  code and homework form GitHub here (https://github.com/Cheukting/python02hero).
