description: 'This week we continue to do data visualisation with Matplotlib, we learn
  what are figures and axes, how to customize your plot by changing the elements in
  your axes, and having multiple subplots in a figure. In the end, we figure out a
  few slow fire type pokemon, can you guess what they are?


  If you have any questions or any suggestions about which Python or Data Science
  topics to cover, please leave your comment at my Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho)


  You can get the slide deck here (https://slides.com/cheukting_ho/legend-data-pandas1/).
  The notebook that I used can be found here (https://github.com/Cheukting/legend_data).
