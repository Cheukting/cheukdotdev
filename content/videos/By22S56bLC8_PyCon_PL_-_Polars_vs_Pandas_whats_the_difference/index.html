description: 'In this talk, we will explore what is Polars, a new tabular data management
  package that is written in Rust and used Arrow. Many people compare it to Pandas,
  the goto package for tabular data management for years. However, there is still
  some confusion regarding what Polars really is, whether or not it is more efficient
  than Pandas and if you can just replace Pandas with Polars. Hopefully, by the end
  of the talk, all of these questions will be answered and for people new to Polars,
  they will feel encouraged to try it out and more confident to make the switch.
