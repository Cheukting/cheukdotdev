description: 'Happy Valentine''s Day Pythonistas! And on this special day, we look
  at the lovely Python standard libraries which are the batteries that are included
  with your Python download. No need to pip install 3rd party libraries you can do
  many things with them. If you have any questions or any suggestions about which
  Python topics to cover, please leave your comment at my Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho)


  You can get the slide deck here (https://slides.com/cheukting_ho) and the example
  code and homework form GitHub here (https://github.com/Cheukting/python02hero).
