description: 'Update: the reason why I cannot install pytest in my environment is
  that I have installed conda yesterday and it messed up the path. Somehow conda overrides
  the pyenv paths so they cannot exist together. You can either keep it and use `python
  -m pytest` every time instead of `pytest` or, like me, remove conda so it works
  again.


  Testing is very important in software development. Unit testing is the smallest
  building block of your tests. It locks a unit of your code in place so making debugging
  much easier. Today we will use Pytest, a popular testing library in Python, to do
  some unit testing. We only cover the basics today and if you are interested to learn
  more about testing using pytest or other libraries, please leave your comment at
  my Twitch channel (https://t.co/7sqvTilzF1?amp=1)


  You can get the slide deck here (https://slides.com/cheukting_ho/python-pytest/)
  and the example code and homework form GitHub here (https://github.com/Cheukting/python02hero).

  more beginner''s (slightly more advance) tutorial.
