description: 'Continue with the last episode, we make more changes to the look of
  the website: fix the pictures of the items and icons of the social media. We have
  more or less got a website that we want - we may add more functionality in the future,
  tell me what you suggest at my Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho). We will
  be ready to add the Netlify CMS to our website next time.


  I used the Turnip Exchange (https://turnip.exchange/) to play with strangers online.
  Also, Nookazon (https://nookazon.com/) is "Amazon" for Animal Crossing, we may also
  use it to find the items that we want.


  The code is work in progress but if you want to check it out, it will be uploaded
  and updated in this repo (https://github.com/Cheukting/animal-crossing-wishlist)
