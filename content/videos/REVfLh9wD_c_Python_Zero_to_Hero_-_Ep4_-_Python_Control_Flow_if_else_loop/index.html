description: 'We got one step closer to writing a Python program. Learning how to
  branch out which path for the program to take base on conditions using if-else,
  we also learn writing loops so the program can do things over and over again with
  slight variation.


  You can get the slide deck here (https://bit.ly/PyControlFlow) and the example code
  and homework form GitHub here (https://github.com/Cheukting/python02hero). Ask questions
  at my Twitch channel (https://t.co/7sqvTilzF1?amp=1)


  Also, check out Naomi Ceder''s Twitch channel (https://t.co/hXhTu0ZIG8?amp=1) for
  more beginner''s (slightly more advance) tutorial.
