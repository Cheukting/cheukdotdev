description: 'Generative AI models are a buzz in recent years, from stable diffusion
  to ChatGPT our social media threads are flooded with people trying them out. However,
  following these models are issues that we have to be aware of. Including biases,
  plagiarism and false information.


  In this talk, we will go through the most popular AI generative models recently,
  just so we can be on the same page. Then for each of them, we will explore some
  issues that arise with those models - including biases within the model that could
  possibly further reinforce stereotypes, copyright issues for articles or images
  that are generated with the models, the potential spreading of false information
  etc.


  We cannot provide definite solutions to those problems but we will conclude the
  talk with some efforts to potentially solve the problem. Hopefully, by spreading
  awareness we can use these powerful models in an ethical way and get the most benefit
  from them while staying away from the potential harm.
