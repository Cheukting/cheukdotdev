  still investigating why*


  Today we continue to explore how we can fit a model to predict the outcome given
  the data. In some cases, the outcome is either this or that, it''s a binary prediction
  and in this case, it cannot be fit with a straight line like we did last week. Therefore,
  we need logistic regression.


  If you have any questions or any suggestions about which Python or Data Science
  topics to cover, please leave your comment at my Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho)


  You can get the slide deck here (https://slides.com/cheukting_ho/legend-data-pandas1/).
  The notebook that I used can be found here (https://github.com/Cheukting/legend_data).
