description: 'To start the topic of data visualisation, we went through why we do
  data visualisation, the common graph types and popular tool for data visualisation
  in Python. We also start talking about Matplotlib, the grand-daddy or the king of
  data visualisation.


  If you have any questions or any suggestions about which Python or Data Science
  topics to cover, please leave your comment at my Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho)


  You can get the slide deck here (https://slides.com/cheukting_ho/legend-data-pandas1/).
