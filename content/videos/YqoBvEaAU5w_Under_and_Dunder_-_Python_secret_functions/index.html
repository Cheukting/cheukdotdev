description: 'At the start, we will be using `dir` to look into the secret functions
  Python objects have. Eg:

  `__getitem__`, `__iter__` and `__next__` Then, we will investigate where is the
  dunder function goes? Why is it not accessible. And at the end, we will see how
  dunder functions can change the identity of the Python objects.


  This talk is for attendees who have just begin their Python journey. By explaining
  the dunder functions and the nature of Python objects, attendees will have a better
  understanding of why Python is fundamentally different from other programming languages.
  Hopefully, this knowledge will help them out when they continue their Python journeys.
