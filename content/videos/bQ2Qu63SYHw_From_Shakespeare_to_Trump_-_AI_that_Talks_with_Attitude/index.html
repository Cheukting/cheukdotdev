description: 'One main application of AI (artificial intelligence) is in NLP (natural
  language processing) which allows the machine to understand neutral languages and
  learn a lot from the context of texts. With tools like Keras (using Tensorflow as
  backend) we can build a neutral network with only 3 layers (Embedding, LSTM, Softmax
  output) in order to "teach" a machine to generate articles, plays or speeches in
  the style of the training corpus and have lots of fun. Will it be like a Shakespearean
  actor in one instance and talk like Trump in another? How well is the AI against
  human in writings now and in the future? How creative could an AI be?
