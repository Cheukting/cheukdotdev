description: 'In this last episode of a series of data visualization tutorial, we
  talked about using Boken, an interactive plotting library to generate some interactive
  plots with our pokemon dataset. We also tried making a widget which will take a
  user''s input to control the look of our plot.


  If you have any questions or any suggestions about which Python or Data Science
  topics to cover, please leave your comment at my Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho)


  You can get the slide deck here (https://slides.com/cheukting_ho/legend-data-pandas1/).
  The notebook that I used can be found here (https://github.com/Cheukting/legend_data).
