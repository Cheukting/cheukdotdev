description: 'We go deeper with Python list and dictionary this time to see how we
  can create a list with the beautiful list comprehension. Also, we will see how we
  can sort a list in various ways. Before we end the episode, we also have a look
  at the OrderedDict and Counter that the Collections library offer. If you have any
  questions or any suggestions about which Python topics to cover, please leave your
  comment at my Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho)


  You can get the slide deck here (https://slides.com/cheukting_ho) and the example
  code and homework form GitHub here (https://github.com/Cheukting/python02hero).
