description: 'This episode is the start of our Animal Crossing Item Wishlist Website
  project. I started to copy my website and change it so anyone can have their own
  item wishlist. Within 1 hour we have changed some of the components in Jekyll templates
  to suit our need. We will continue next week.


  We will be using the pictures and information on Animal Crossing Fandom wiki page
  - list of all funitures (https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Furniture_(New_Horizons)).


  The code is work in progress but if you want to check it out, it will be uploaded
  and updated in this repo (https://github.com/Cheukting/animal-crossing-wishlist)


  I am thinking about doing 1.5 hours starting next week so we can get this project
  done quicker. Please leave any comments and thoughts in the panels of my Twitch
  channel (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho) make sure to follow me to catch me
  live on more coding and Python contents.
