<p>Python is one of the programming languages that has a huge open-source supply chain. There are over 400,000 Python packages on Python Package Index (PyPI) and many more on other registries. Making sure this and the wider Python ecosystem are secure is a huge job and requires consistent contributions. Thanks to OpenSSFâ€™s Alpha-Omega project, we now have a PSF Security Developer-in-Residence whose responsibility includes a security audit of the PyPI codebase and infrastructure, improving security practices, and establishing metrics on security posture to show impact. In this talk, we will have the PSF Security Developer-in-Residence himself talk about the effort that has been put in and plans to make Python safer.
