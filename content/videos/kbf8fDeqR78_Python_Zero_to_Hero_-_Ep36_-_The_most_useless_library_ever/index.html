description: 'Today you will be making the most useless Python library with me ever.
  We will start this week and keep on building this library (so hopefully at the end
  it will be not so useless). If you have any questions or any suggestions about which
  Python topics to cover, please leave your comment at my Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho)


  You can get the slide deck here (https://slides.com/cheukting_ho) and the example
  code and homework form GitHub here (https://github.com/Cheukting/python02hero).
