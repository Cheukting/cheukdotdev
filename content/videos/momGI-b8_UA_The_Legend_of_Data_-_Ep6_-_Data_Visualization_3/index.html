description: 'Continue form last week, we try plotting by simply using df.plot. It
  uses Matplotlib as a back end and make plotting much easier. Also, we tried out
  Seaborn, a library that makes beautiful plots by providing a higher-level API on
  top of Matplotlib.


  If you have any questions or any suggestions about which Python or Data Science
  topics to cover, please leave your comment at my Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho)


  You can get the slide deck here (https://slides.com/cheukting_ho/legend-data-pandas1/).
  The notebook that I used can be found here (https://github.com/Cheukting/legend_data).
