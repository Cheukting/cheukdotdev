<p>In this talk, we will use venv, the environment managing tool that come with CPython, and conda, the tool that is popular among data science partitioners to decipher how environment and dependency management works. First, we will go through some basic knowledge of how Python “sees” your package and know where to import them when needed. Then, we will make the audience aware that, to avoid the requirement conflict amount different projects, we need a new set of environments for each project.
