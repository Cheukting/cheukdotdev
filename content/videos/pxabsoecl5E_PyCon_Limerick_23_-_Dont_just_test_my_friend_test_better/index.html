description: 'We all know that we need to write tests, some of you may even practice
  test-driven development. Pytest provides lots of tools for you to write better tests,
  however, not all of them we are familiar with. Let''s revisit them and see how they
  can be used to write better tests.


  In this talk, we will visit some valuable tools in Pytest, for example, parameterize,
  fixture and xfail. All of them provided what problem these tool is trying to solve,
  an example use case and an example code. The talk will be conducted in a storytelling
  kind of way, with an example project and writing a test suit to test different features
  in the project. The goal of this talk is to give beginner code a head start in improving
  their ability to write meaningful and complex tests.


  This talk is for beginner programmers and data scientists who can write Python code
  and know the basics of testing but have yet to get their hands dirty in writing
  complex tests that, for example, involve an external application, which will require
  extra tools from Pytest to achieve that.
