description: 'I left Hong Kong, the place that I was born and lived for 30 years,
  5 years ago with no technical experience. (Except for a few programming experience
  in University time, mainly serves my research studies) Moving to London, a city
  where technology is in high demand, opens a lot of doors for me. Here I know about
  open-source and Python. I learnt Python, been to lots of meet-ups and made lots
  of friends. I was welcomed by the community with open arms, in here I have met smart
  people, dedicated people, fun and nerdy people, and all of them are lovely. I am
  not joking if I say Python gave me this new life. I am so proud to be a Pythonistas,
  grateful about where I am now that I would like to share my journey with you. I
  hope everyone will find their journey in this amazing community.
