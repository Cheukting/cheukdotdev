  However, there are many reasons why we would like to annotate the type of variables
  in our code. In this episode, we will explore those scenarios and look at how type
  hinting works in Python. If you have any questions or any suggestions about which
  Python topics to cover, please leave your comment at my Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho)


  You can get the slide deck here (https://slides.com/cheukting_ho) and the example
