description: 'To make code usable we have to ensure users and developers know what
  the code is doing. We can add comments to explain thing but it''s still limited.
  That''s why we need to write docstrings in Python and with a bit of magic (a.k.a
  Sphinx) we can make the docstrings into a documentation website. If you have any
  questions or any suggestions about which Python topics to cover, please leave your
  comment at my Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho)


  You can get the slide deck here (https://slides.com/cheukting_ho) and the example
  code and homework form GitHub here (https://github.com/Cheukting/python02hero).
