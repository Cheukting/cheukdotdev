description: 'In this episode, we will be Introducing various metrics, standard measurements
  that we will use to measure how "good" a model is. Being able to pick the right
  model for your machine learning predictions is one of the most important things
  in data science.


  If you have any questions or any suggestions about which Python or Data Science
  topics to cover, please leave your comment at my Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho)


  You can get the slide deck here (https://slides.com/cheukting_ho/legend-data-pandas1/).
