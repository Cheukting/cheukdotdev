description: 'Python classes provide functionalities for Object-Oriented Programming.
  Today we explore how to write classes in Python, clear some concepts of scopes.
  We learn by purposely breaking some code.


  You can get the slide deck here (https://slides.com/cheukting_ho/python-classes#/)
  and the example code and homework form GitHub here (https://github.com/Cheukting/python02hero).
