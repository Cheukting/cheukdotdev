description: 'Have you been troubled by Python code that took too long to run? Do
  you want to know why and how to improve?


  In this workshop, we will introduce Numba - a JIT compiler that is designed to speed
  up numerical calculations. Most people found all of it is like a mystery - It sounds
  like magic, but how does it work? Under what conditions does it work? And because
  of it, new users found it hard to start using it and it requires a steep learning
  curve to get the hang of it. This workshop will provide all the knowledge that you
  need to make Numba works for you.


  This workshop is for Data scientists or developers who have math-heavy code that
  would like to speed up with the benefit of Numpy and Numba.
