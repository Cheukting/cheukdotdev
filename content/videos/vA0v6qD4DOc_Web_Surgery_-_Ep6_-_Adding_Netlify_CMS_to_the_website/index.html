description: 'This episode we will start to add Netlify CMS so the website. It can
  easily be done by adding an html and config.yml under admin. It is promising running
  on localhost but it is not fully working yet because we still have to figure out
  the Auth for GitHub, also we may add more functionality in the future, tell me what
  you suggest at my Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho).


  The code is work in progress but if you want to check it out, it will be uploaded
  and updated in this repo (https://github.com/Cheukting/animal-crossing-wishlist)
