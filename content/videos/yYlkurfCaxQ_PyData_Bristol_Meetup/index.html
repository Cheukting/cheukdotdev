description: 'Using Numba Effectively Today - Cheuk Ting Ho


  Have you ever heard of Numba? It is (mainly) a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler to make
  your math-heavy Python code run faster under certain conditions. Most people found
  all of it is like a mystery - It sounds like magic, but how does it work? Under
  what conditions does it work? And because of it, new users found it hard to start
  using it and it requires a steep learning curve to get the hang of it.


  This talk requires no prior experience. Through demos, we will explore in what situation
  Numba works, when it does not and the reason why. We will also look at some cases
  where we can make Numba works by changing a few things in your code. Hopefully,
  by the end of the talk, you will have a better understanding of how Numba works
  before you even start using it. This knowledge can save you some time on try and
  error, making your experience in using it better.
