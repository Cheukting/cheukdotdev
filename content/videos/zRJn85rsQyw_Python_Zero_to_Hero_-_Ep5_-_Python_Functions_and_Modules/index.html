description: 'Today we go through a very important thing in Python - functions. I
  so thought the usage of it and some common mistakes that beginners could make. Also,
  we touch on importing modules - either it is a standard library or another python
  scripts.


  You can get the slide deck here (https://bit.ly/PyFunction) and the example code
  and homework form GitHub here (https://github.com/Cheukting/python02hero). Ask questions
