description: 'Mozilla has been promoting WASM for years, on the other hand, HTMX is
  gaining attraction. Question is, do we want more frontend or more backend? Do we
  still need to write JavaScripts?


  In the first half of the talk we would explore the history of WASM and the Iodide
  project, what they enable and the closing of the Iodide project. Then we will talk
  about the rise of the Pyodide project and what this project enables - including
  another popular framework - PyScript. There will be some quick code demo of both
  Pyodide and PyScript.


  In the second half of the talk, we will switch our attention to HTMX, what''s the
  idea behind it and how it can be used to access AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets
  and Server-Sent Events directly in HTML. There will also be some code demos of how
  to use HTMX, especially using it together with Django.


  In the last part of the talk, there will be a conclusion, do we want more backend
  or more frontend? And most importantly, will web developers ever need to write JavaScript
  anymore?


  Goal

  The attendee of this talk will explore several popular tools in recent years which
  will make them rethink their approach to building their applications. Hopefully,
  by seeing the live demos, they are encouraged to try these tools out and learn more
  about the use case and how it can help them in future projects.
